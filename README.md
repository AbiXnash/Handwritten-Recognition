# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Overview

This project demonstrates a basic Handwritten Digit Recognition system using machine learning. It takes an input image of a handwritten digit and predicts the digit using a pre-trained model.

### Features

- Recognizes handwritten digits (0-9).
- Minimal setup required.
- Great for learning the basics of image recognition.

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to set up and run the Handwritten Digit Recognition system on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbiXnash/Handwritten-Recognition.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd handwritten-digit-recognition
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the recognition system:

   ```bash
   python recognize.py --input input_image.jpg
   ```

   Replace `input_image.jpg` with the path to your input image containing a handwritten digit (0-9).

2. The recognized digit will be displayed in the console output.
